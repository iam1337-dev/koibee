# Koibee - A Random User Generator

A zero dependency library for generating random users without any API calls.


## Features

- Filter by Nationalities & Gender
- Including/Excluding fields
- Requesting multiple users
- Focus on high performance


## Installation

Install with npm

```bash
$ npm i -g npm
$ npm i --save koibee
```
## Quick Start

The quickest way to get started with "koibee" is to import the module and call it as a function to get output as a random user:
```bash
const koibee = require('koibee')

console.log(koibee())
```

**Requesting multiple users:**

The "koibee" allows you to fetch up to 1,000 generated users in one request using the **results** option. 
```bash
console.log(koibee({ results: 10 }))
```

**Specifying a gender:**

You can specify whether you would like to have only male or only female users generated by adding the gender parameter to your request. Valid values for the gender parameter are "m" or "f", or you may leave the parameter blank. Any other value will cause the service to return both male and female users.
```bash
console.log(koibee({ gender: 'f' }))
```

**Including/Excluding fields:**

Sometimes, maybe you want some random names and not extraneous data such as location, phone, etc.
Using the inc and exc parameters, you can specify which fields to include or exclude respectively.

These parameters accept the following values in a array:
- fullName
- firstName
- lastName
- username
- email
```bash
console.log(koibee({}, { include: ['fullName'] }))
console.log(koibee({}, { exclude: ['email', 'firstName'] }))
```

**Example with all options:**
```bash
// Input
console.log(koibee({ 
    gender: 'f',
    nat: 'in',
    results: 10  
},
{ 
    include: ['fullName', 'username'], 
    exclude: ['phone'] 
}))
```
```bash
// Output
[
  { fullName: 'Upasana Banerjee', username: 'upasanabanerjee' },
  { fullName: 'Lakshmi Das', username: 'lakshmidas' }
]
```
